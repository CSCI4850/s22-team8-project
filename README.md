## Team #8 - Inverse Nutrition Mapping


This neural network is designed to take in bread recipies and their macro and micronutrients, such as those off of a nutritional facts label, and the network will return the masses of each ingredient (in grams) in descending order. For example:

Taking in these nutrients:

| Calories | Total Fat         | Saturated Fat | Cholesterol | Sodium | Total Carbs | Fiber  | Sugar | Protein | Vitamin D | Calcium | Iron     | Potassium |       |       |

When processed through our network, would be able to replicate a recipe such as this:


|   | Recipe                    | Bread flour | Water | Butter | Sugar | Salt | Dry milk | Active dry yeast | Egg | Whole wheat flour | Vegetable oil | Olive oil | Honey | Brown sugar | All-purpose flour | Milk |

| 1 | "Traditional White Bread" | 408         | 236   | 14     | 12.6  | 8.6  | 8.48     | 5.6              | 0   | 0                 | 0             | 0         | 0     | 0           | 0                 | 0    |

## Running our Demo

1. You will need Python 3.0 or higher. This can be found on the Python website [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Our project is written in .ipynb files that require Jupyter Notebook [(Install here)](https://jupyter.org/install) to run.
3. Once inside Jupyter Notebook, a few tools will need to be imported to run a demo:

```
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow.keras as keras
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import csv

from Generator import Generator
from RealData import RealData

from IPython.display import Image
```

## Companion Files

We used a website to convert our ingredients to their relative nutrient values which yielded these results [here](main/nutrients.csv).

We wrote a generator to generate random recipes for testing, but we also used a small list of [real recipes](main/Recipe_Data.csv) as well

## Let's Run the Demo!
